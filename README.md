# The F# compiler, F# core library, and F# editor tools

You're invited to contribute to future releases of the F# compiler, core library, and tools. Development of this repository can be done on any OS supported by [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).

## Contributing

### Quickstart on Windows

Build from the command line:

```bash
build.cmd
```

After it's finished, open either `FSharp.sln` or `VisualFSharp.sln` in your editor of choice. The latter solution is larger but includes the F# tools for Visual Studio and its associated infrastructure.

### Quickstart on Linux or macOS

Build from the command line:

```bash
sh ./build.sh
```

After it's finished, open `FSharp.sln` in your editor of choice.

### More options and information

See [DEVGUIDE.md](DEVGUIDE.md) and [TESTGUIDE.md](TESTGUIDE.md) for more details on additional configurations for building and testing, how to update compiler error messages, and more.

### No contribution is too small

Even if you find a single-character typo, we're happy to take the change! Although the codebase can feel daunting for beginners, we and other contributors are happy to help you along.

## Build Status

| Branch | Status |
|:------:|:------:|
|master|[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_apis/build/status/dotnet/fsharp/fsharp-ci?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/latest?definitionId=496&branchName=master)|

## Using nightly releases in Visual Studio

You can use the latest `master` build of the F# compiler and tools for Visual Studio via our nightly releases if you are a Visual Studio user. See details on setup here:

https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/03/14/announcing-nightly-releases-for-the-visual-f-tools/

### Even more nightly than the nightly

Alternatively, if you _really_ want to live on the bleeding edge, you can set up a nightly feed for the Visual Studio preview releases, which use the latest commit in the preview branch. To do so, follow the same instructions as the above blog post, but instead with these links:

* Set your feed to the preview feed: https://dotnet.myget.org/F/fsharp-preview/vsix
* Install a VSIX manually from the preview feed: https://dotnet.myget.org/feed/fsharp-preview/package/vsix/VisualFSharp

## Branches

These are the branches in use:

* `master`
  - Most contributions go here.
  - Able to be built, installed and used in the latest public Visual Studio release.
  - May contain updated F# features and logic.
  - Used to build nightly VSIX (see above).
  - Gets integrated into https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp to form the basis of Mono releases
  - Gets integrated into https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service to form the basis of FSharp.Compiler.Service releases

* `dev15.9`
  - Long-term servicing branch for VS 2017 update 15.9.x. We do not expect to service that release, but if we do, that's where the changes will go.
  
* `dev16.x`
  - Latest release branch for the particular point release of Visual Studio.
  - Incorporates features and fixes from master up to a particular branch point, then selective cherry-picks.
  - May contain new features that depend on new things or fixes in the corresponding forthcoming Visual Studio release.
  - Gets integrated back into master once the corresponding Visual Studio release is made.

## F# language and core library evolution

Evolution of the F# language and core library follows a process spanning two additional repositories. The process is as follows:

1. Use the [F# language suggestions repo](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/) to search for ideas, vote on ones you like, submit new ideas, and discuss details with the F# community.
2. Ideas that are "approved in principle" are eligible for a new RFC in the [F# language design repo](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design). This is where the technical specification and discussion of approved suggestions go.
3. Implementations and testing of an RFC are submitted to this repository.

## Additional project documentation

The following links can help you get an overview of some technical aspects of the F# language and compiler:

* [The F# Compiler Technical Guide](http://fsharp.github.io/2015/09/29/fsharp-compiler-guide.html) 
* [The F# Language Specification](http://fsharp.org/specs/language-spec/)

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
